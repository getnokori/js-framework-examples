# lolaDB Frontend Framework Examples

lolaDB works with nearly every frontend framework. Javascript or Typescript.

This repository contains examples for many of today's most popular frontend frameworks.

## Available Examples

- [React](./react)
- [Svelte](./svelte)
- [Vue](./vue)

## .env Files

Annoyingly, different frameworks utilize .env files in their own way, often with non-obvious documentation.

For these examples, you must set your lola API key in the .env file in this manner:

### React

```bash
REACT_APP_LOLA_API_KEY={{YOUR_API_KEY}}
```

### Svelte

```bash
VITE_LOLA_API_KEY={{YOUR_API_KEY}}
```
